### Intro

PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.



Around 510,000 students in [65 economies](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.oecd.org/pisa/aboutpisa/pisa-2012-participants.htm&sa=D&ust=1560360684115000) took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.

- The data and topics of investigation come from the [PISA Data Visualization Competition](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/datavisualizationcontest.htm&sa=D&ust=1560360684116000).

### Questiones

1. A very old question, is the boy's mathematics better, and the girl reading?
2. Is it better to have a child with a parent at home?
3. Are the scores of students in different countries more high?
4. Which countries have better scores in which subjects? (For example: Is the mathematics in Asian countries good? Is the European country reading well?)

### Insights

1. Excluding the stereotypes of female students with poor mathematics, female students are not inferior to male students in mathematics, and are more prominent in reading.
2. Parental companionship is helpful for students' learning. Students' learning grows only once, parents should not miss
3. Different countries have strong and weak performances in different subjects. For example, Italy has a high reading score and is good in mathematics and science. China has high mathematics and weak reading.
4. Comparing the scores of each country in each subject, it seems that Asian countries are more prominent in each subject.
